      <dd>This is an experiment with building GUI interactions with the canvas element.  It depends only on jQuery.  Try dragging your mouse around the screen.  The on-screen data is easily serializable in completely undecorated JSON.  The goal is to be able to import and export item representations from a remote server, as demonstrated by pressing the key "l" (lowercase L), which actually makes an XHR request.  The data exchanged could very easily be bidirectional and dynamic.   Press "c" to clear the screen.</dd>
